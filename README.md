index.php(main page)--->form.php(login page)--->login.php(checking the creditials if wrong redirecting to form.php)--->home.php(final output)</br>

## for New user:
index.php(main page)--->form.php(login page)--->signup.php(for new user after clicking the buttton)--->check.php(verify the user details)--->form.php(login with succcessfully created accout:) )---> home.php(final output)</br>
